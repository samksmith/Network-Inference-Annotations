# Network-Inference-Annotations
Samantha K. Smith, UT Austin, samksmith@utexas.edu

This method uses the output of gene expression analyses to create contextual and functional annotation of genes within relevant networks. We used this method on gene expression data from red drum larvae. This project contains scripts for generating annotations as well as the red drum behavioral data and associated annotation files. Red drum reads used in this study will be available at the Short Read Archive (NCBI SRA: https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.lib.utexas.edu/sra) soon.
